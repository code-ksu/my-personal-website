It all starts with an idea. You wake up in the middle of the night with a game-changing product in mind — one that could disrupt the market and bring something entirely new to the table. You sketch it out, build a prototype, and even find a few people who love it. But then, reality hits. How do you actually get it out there? How do you make sure your product finds its audience?

In the episode of Startup Sl*ts, we sat down with Anna, a seasoned expert in marketing strategy and international B2B business development. She’s helped startups (including ours!) navigate the tricky waters of launching a product, and today, she’s breaking down exactly what it takes to craft a winning go-to-market (GTM) strategy.

## The Difference Between a Marketing Strategy and a Go-To-Market Strategy

Before we dove into the nitty-gritty details, Anna helped us clear up one major misconception: a go-to-market strategy is not the same as a marketing strategy.
“Think of launching a rocket,” she explained. “Your GTM strategy is everything you need to get that rocket off the ground — the research, positioning, and launch plan. Once the rocket is in orbit, your marketing strategy takes over to keep it moving”.

While marketing strategies focus on long-term brand building, GTM strategies are short-term, action-packed plans designed to introduce a product to the market in a way that maximizes its chance of success.

## Step One: Know Your Product (Like, Really Know It)

One of the biggest mistakes startups make? Assuming they know their product well enough. “You’d be surprised how many founders idealize their products,” Anna said. “They see it from their own perspective, not from the market’s”.

Understanding your product goes beyond features. It’s about knowing how it fits into the competitive landscape, what makes it stand out, and how people will actually use it. And sometimes, that means being brutally honest about its shortcomings.

## Step Two: Understand Your Audience

Imagine throwing a huge party but forgetting to send out invitations. That’s what happens when startups launch without knowing their audience.

“We created personas,” Anna shared. “Imaginary users with names, backgrounds, and specific needs. This helped us tailor our messaging and marketing channels”.

Creating personas might feel like an abstract exercise, but it helps you get inside the mind of your ideal customers. What are their pain points? Where do they hang out online? How do they make purchasing decisions? The more you know, the more targeted (and effective) your GTM strategy will be.

## Step Three: Position Yourself Wisely

Not every product benefits from being the first of its kind. In some cases, competition is actually a good thing.

“Look at bubble tea,” Anna pointed out. “It’s everywhere, and that’s what makes it popular. If you’re launching a product like that, you don’t need to prove the demand — you need to position yourself in the best location”.

On the other hand, if you’re bringing something entirely new to the market, you need to educate your audience and possibly secure patents to establish yourself as the go-to brand in your niche.

## Step Four: Messaging & Pricing — Getting It Just Right

Once you know your audience and positioning, it’s time to craft the right message. This means:
- Communicating the problem your product solves
- Explaining why it’s better than alternatives
- Making sure it speaks directly to the right people

And then there’s pricing — a delicate balancing act. “You can have an amazing product, but if it’s priced wrong, you’ll struggle,” Anna warned. “Too high, and you alienate your market. Too low, and you devalue your brand”.

## Step Five: Flexibility & Adaptation

A GTM strategy is never set in stone. “Your first plan won’t be perfect,” Anna admitted. “You need to stay flexible and adjust based on real-world feedback”.

Data is your best friend. Analyze user behavior, track KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and be ready to tweak your approach. The most successful startups aren’t those with a flawless plan from day one — they’re the ones who pivot smartly when needed.

## Lessons from the Real World

Anna shared a fascinating case study of a French dating site that took a bold approach. They launched an offline marketing campaign with cryptic billboards featuring a woman putting a man into a shopping cart — no text, no explanation. Curiosity skyrocketed. A few weeks later, they revealed the website name, AdopteUnMec.com (Adopt a Man). By building intrigue before revealing their brand, they ensured people were already talking about them before they even knew what they were signing up for.

## Digital vs. Offline Marketing — What Works Best?

While digital marketing is a must, offline strategies still have their place. “People still go outside,” Anna joked. “A well-placed billboard or event can drive just as much traction as a viral post”.

The key? A blended approach. SEO and search engine rankings will help people find you online, while social media creates engagement. Offline strategies — like guerrilla marketing — can add a layer of brand memorability that digital alone can’t achieve.

## Final Thoughts: Just Start, Then Adapt

At the end of the day, launching a product isn’t about having a perfect plan — it’s about getting started and refining as you go.

“Learn the basics, get inspired by real examples, and stay flexible,” Anna advised. “Your first GTM strategy won’t be your last. Just go, go, go!”
So if you’re sitting on a great idea but aren’t sure how to launch it, start with the steps above. The market is waiting — but only if you know how to reach it.

Imagine this: you’ve just received your personal domain, a blank digital canvas brimming with possibilities. Most people might take the straightforward path—signing up for a website builder, choosing a template, and calling it a day. But not me. Instead, I decided to take a leap into uncharted territory: building this website from scratch using React, all while relying on an AI coding companion to guide me.

I’ll admit, it wasn’t an entirely logical choice. My native coding language is Python, and I’d never written a single line of React before. But the challenge itself was what made it irresistible. A cocktail of curiosity, ambition, and stubbornness drove me to dive in headfirst. My partner on this journey? Claude, an AI assistant I handpicked after poring over benchmarks and user reviews.

The goal was simple: combine my vision for a clean, modern UX with Claude’s coding capabilities to create something uniquely mine. But, as with any ambitious project, the reality was far more complex than the initial dream.

## The First Hour: Beginner's Luck?

In the early stages, things looked promising. Within an hour, I had a basic iteration of the site up and running. Claude generated clean React code and styled it with Tailwind, bringing my design ideas to life almost effortlessly. It felt magical, like having an invisible teammate who never slept.

But it didn’t take long for cracks to appear in the seamless façade. Claude’s npm suggestions were outdated, leading to frustrating errors. I had to manually research and update dependencies, quickly realizing that some things AI just can’t automate.
Then came my first technical challenge: creating an animated wave effect for the text. Despite my best efforts, Claude couldn’t find or suggest the right plugin for the job, even with reference code at its disposal. It became painfully clear that while AI can assist, it can’t always solve creative problems on its own.

## The Reality of AI Limitations

As the project progressed, I encountered a more fundamental issue: Claude’s limited context window. It worked fine for a single landing page, but the moment I tried to expand beyond that, things fell apart. Theoretically, it could "learn" from existing files, but in practice, this feature was unreliable. I found myself stuck in a loop of starting over for each new page.

That’s when I decided to explore other options, eventually landing on Windsurf — a tool I’d heard whispers about but hadn’t yet tried.

## Enter Windsurf: A Game-Changer

The first time I opened Windsurf, I wasn’t expecting much. After my experience with Claude and GitHub Copilot, my expectations were tempered. But as I began using it, something clicked.

It felt like I had leveled up my AI teammate. Windsurf wasn’t just generating code — it was helping me think like a developer. One of its standout features was the way it automatically cleaned up my codebase, identifying unused files and redundant snippets without me lifting a finger. I remember staring at the clean folder structure it produced and thinking, This is what I’ve been missing.

Another breakthrough came with something Windsurf calls “Cascade Memories.” At first, the name sounded overly technical, but it turned out to be a lifesaver. It allowed me to set rules for the AI — globally or specific to each workspace — so I could maintain consistency across the project without constantly micromanaging the tool.

Windsurf also had a knack for context-aware code completion. Unlike Claude, which often offered generic snippets, Windsurf’s suggestions felt eerily intuitive. It wasn’t perfect, but it was close enough to make my workflow faster and smoother.

## The Quirks and Challenges

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. There were moments when Windsurf frustrated me as much as it helped.

I’ll never forget the time it suggested deleting an entire section of functional code that had nothing to do with my query. Or the times it struggled with basic features that I knew even beginners could code manually in minutes. Debugging these errors felt like untangling a string of Christmas lights: tedious and unavoidable.

And then there was the architecture. While Windsurf helped me write code, it couldn’t make decisions about how to structure the project. For example, when it came to organizing my blog posts, I had to seek advice from a more experienced developer who suggested Markdown. Windsurf couldn’t make that leap on its own.
Still, for every misstep, there were moments of brilliance.

## A Mixed Blessing for Developers

Windsurf gave me a glimpse into the future of coding a world where AI doesn’t replace developers but amplifies their abilities. For senior developers, tools like Windsurf are a productivity dream. What used to take a week can now be done in two days.
But I couldn’t ignore the implications for junior developers. In a world where AI accelerates senior developers’ work, will companies still be willing to hire and train young specialists? It’s a troubling thought, especially in today’s economic climate.

## The Future of AI

As I look back on this journey, I realize that this website isn’t just a collection of pages — it’s a partnership between humans, me, experienced developer and AI. Tools like Windsurf aren’t perfect, but they’re a step forward, showing us what’s possible when we combine human with dedication and experience with cutting-edge technology.
Building this site taught me one important lesson: AI can’t replace human yet, but it can be a powerful ally.
